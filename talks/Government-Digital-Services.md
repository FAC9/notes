# Government Digital Services

## Who is GDS?

Martha Lane Fox - Digital Inclusion Champion (government role), co-founder of Lastminute.com, on the board of Twitter.) Commissioned by cabinet minister, Francis Maude, to looking into all directgov websites. Came back with 11 page letter, instead of huge report - "You asked me to oversee a strategic review of Directgov...This means that I have not reviewed Directgov in isolation".

Wanted to move from waterfall to agile sprints (agile, beta, live)

GDS created in 2011 - the 14 people who made gov.uk. Now 500 people.

Phase 1:  - Discovery

e.g. Sitting with those who were campaigning against there being a single online database to store everyone's details
NB: GDS has history of testing too early, wants to start working with qualitative measures

Phase 2: 2013-2015 - Technology and transformation
Digital Transformation
People from GDS went into services, talked to people, got 25 services Live (9 in Beta, 12 in Alpha).
Carer's allowance

Phase 3: 2016 - Platforms and Services
Services coming up against the same problem, trying to make the same thing.
e.g. People want to set up a payment, to send to a prisoner.
Other people want to set up a payment to pay for their new passport.
Create a set of shared components - GOV.UK NOTIFY (going into Beta)

GDS is here to support, enable and assure departments as they go through transformation.


## Tom - being a Product Manager
Currently working on the part of Verify that allows non-UK users. Verify has just had its millionth user, next milestone is 24 million in 3 years.

### What is a product manager?
Responsible for what we do and why we do it.
- Understand who my user is, and figure out what things I can do for that user
  - User story: Javier Garcia (a Spanish guy living in the UK)
- [Martin Ericsson's Venn diagram](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/what_is_a_product_manager.png) - finding what works for all parties: UX, Tech & Business, and being the communicator between these areas.  
Hard to describe how to be good at finding this sweet spot.  
Your whole job is finding this, losing it again, refinding it, over and over.
  - Have to be willing to say no, because your job is to balance multiple people's interests

Case study: Lonely Planet
Pitching idea: break-up guidebooks into PDFs and sell chapters online.  
Users -
Tech - easy enough to do
Business - didn't want to "cannibalise"

Solution - cut back perception of risk / level of risk associated with it, by asking to do a smaller version.

Lesson:  
As a product manager, wasn't appreciating how to frame the idea in a way that worked for the business.

### What is a project manager?
Responsible for how we do it and when we do it.
- Focus - deliver the right things

So the product & project managers' roles overlap, but they're not the same thing.

### What is a product owner?
A role in agile development - a Scrum role.
- Make prioritisation decisions about what the team is doing
- Working _in_ a sprint _with_ the team
Hence, depending on the team/company, the product manager and product owner may be the same person.

### Product at GDS
Also called service management.
Team of 25,a cross most major programmes
Include product ownership and management
Recognised digital skill within government


## Richard Towers - being a software developer at GDS

### How I became a developer
- Mechanical Engineering at uni
- Constant imposter syndrome
- Can learn a lot from legacy jobs - sometimes there is one guy holding back the tide & if you latch onto them

### What being a develop is like
[Fred Brooks - Mythical Man Month](http://people.apache.org/~acmurthy/WhyIsProgrammingFun.html)
- pretentious but brilliant :wink:

:+1: Having a job where someone pays you to experience the joy of creation is brilliant
:-1: Spend a lot of your time configuring old code, not having the joy of creating something new

A lot of your job is about questioning
- What actually are the requirements?
- Are we building things that are right for the user?

Sometimes you meet someone who is absolutely brilliant, without whom the whole company wouldn't exist. Even if you find them in a terrible company, sometimes it's worth sticking around just to learn from them.

You can get quite jaded, especially if you're stuck in a job where you're not learning anything. Don't worry, you're a programmer - you can find another one! Yay!

## Life at GDS
**Ethical drive**
Different from other places: relentless focus on users. Because even if you don't think about your users, government services are the only way they can do what they need to do, so you will still have users...they will just hate you.

"Does Agile more than anywhere else I've worked" - in a whole industry of people who just say they 'do' agile
