# Stop, go, continue

9th Dec (week 8)

## Stop

### Morning challenges

We'd prefer to keep to an hour if on a project day. Also, be selective with topic so that they're relevant to project if happening on a project day.

## Go

### More explanation of implementations

Suggest more than just one workshop if the implementation of a concept is quite involved. OAuth workshop was really useful and something on JWT would have been good.

We would like to go through session management, including the steps of implementing session management in JWT etc, earlier in the week.

We should flag to future cohorts which JWT module to use to avoid them using poorly-suited modules (though it was a useful learning experience in itself).

### Pair programming

Agree on how pair programming should work so that pairs do it consistently.

Model suggested by Eoin is: half an hour and then swap. Other pair should review code. Recommend that person watching is driving.

But within these limits pairs can find what works for both of them.

### Code reviews by <= FAC8

Some teams had comments but not all. People find them very useful so grateful for more comments.

### Work in pairs after code reviews

Keep working in pairs rather than splitting off. This would be a good way to make sure everyone's abreast of changes.

Also, pairing during code review could be a good way to spark discussion and more analysis.

### Prep time for presentations

We need to think about how to make our project presentations the most effective.

For example, rather than quickly running through the code we could pick out points of interest. The high-level structure / operation of a project could be more usefully expressed via diagrams etc rather than showing the code.

Maybe get < FAC9 to present on their projects? (As Noga and Sofia did early in the course). People found this interesting and useful.

Sohil / Justen to talk through his project next week.

## Continue

We found the OAuth talk really useful.

Thanks to everyone who came to the Lead-In talk. Having a decent turnout from FAC is really important. We are chasing up possible sponsorship from Google Deep Mind (very tbc).

We liked this week's fun, structured project ideas.

This week's morning projects were well-structured, clear and covered useful concepts so thanks.
