# User stories

Think about the perspective of the non-technical person who is going to be using your application.


## Writing user stories

A formula can help you:  
**As a** ... foreign language student  
**I want to**... be able to learn new words  
**so that**... I can improve my English vocabulary  

Most successful ventures start by solving a particular solution for a small subset of people, and if it is successful, then generalise to be applicable to more people. Look at the history of Google - they were trying to focus on something specific originally. It only became general later.

### Context: autocompleter
**As** someone who wants to become the champion of countdown  
**I want** to see only words that are between 6 and 8 characters long  
**so that** I can learn more long words

## Technical Debt
When you are writing code, you are spending money on your credit card that someone else is going to have to pay off later.

If you start working on a feature and you don't have a specific scenario that you are working on,
when someone else joins your project, they won't be able to figure out why that feature has been built or what value it adds.

Given a broad requirement i.e. the FAC9 gitbook brief for our autocompleters, you need to come up with your own user stories in your teams.

## How specific should they be

There is no one answer to this, but here is some advice:
1. Once you have your first story, try to break it down into smaller user stories. Hopefully this happens to the point where each story is a bitesize chunk. Each person/pair can then take each chunk and go away and research the best way to solve this before trying to do it themselves.

2. Try to get to the point when you are testing one single thing, that has impact on other parts of the code. e.g. Knowing that a box exists on the page. Being able to type into a box.

3. If you can get to the point where you are solving the problem before writing any code, the code will write itself.
